# PONG-IT Startup Guide

## 1. Quick Start

Refer to `frontend/README.md`, `backend/README.md`, and `blockchain/README.md` for service-specific commands in addition to the steps below.

Once the repo is cloned, follow the steps below and refer to `frontend/README.md`, `backend/README.md`, and `blockchain/README.md` for service-specific instructions.

### Prerequisites
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- 8GB RAM available
- Ports 3000, 8080, and 5001 available

### Starting the Application

**1. Open Terminal/Command Prompt**

```bash
cd path/to/k-pong
```

**2. Start All Services**

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This single command will:
- Build Docker images for all 3 services
- Start containers in correct order
- Display logs from all services

**3. Wait for Services to Start**

Watch the logs until you see:
```
frontend_1         | webpack compiled successfully
backend_1          | Server running on port 8080
player-service_1   | Player ranking service running on port 5001
```

**4. Open Your Browser**

Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000`

**5. Play!**

Enter your username and start playing!

## 2. Environment Matrix

| Component | Variable | Scope | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend (`frontend/.env`) | `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` | Browser (React) | `http://localhost:8080` | Used for Socket.IO + REST calls. Change to the Fly.io / Base URL when deploying. |
| Frontend | `FRONTEND_PORT` | Local dev server | `3000` | Matches the port exposed in `docker-compose.yml`. |
| Backend (`backend/.env`) | `PLAYER_SERVICE_URL` | Node service | `http://player-service:5001` | Replace with `http://localhost:5001` when running everything outside Docker. |
| Backend | `BACKEND_PORT` | Node service | `8080` | Must stay in sync with `frontend/.env` target. |
| Player Service (`backend/.env`) | `PLAYER_SERVICE_URL` | Node service | `http://player-service:5001` | Governs leaderboard polling + stats persistence. |
| Blockchain (`blockchain/.env`) | `CHAIN_RPC_URL` | Foundry scripts | *(none)* | Provide a Base / Sepolia RPC endpoint (Alchemy, Blast, etc.). |
| Blockchain | `PRIVATE_KEY` | Foundry scripts | *(none)* | Test signer for deployments; never commit real keys. |

> ℹ️ **Tip:** Create separate `.env.local` files when iterating outside Docker so you can switch targets without rewriting the shared sample env files. Always keep secrets (private keys, API tokens) out of source control.

## 4. Troubleshooting FAQ

Stuck while onboarding? Start with these targeted checks before escalating.

### Q1. "Cannot connect to backend"

**Fix:**

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

If you're running services individually, confirm the frontend `.env` still points at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Q2. "Port already in use"

**Find what's using the port:**

```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :8080
```

**Stop Docker and try again:**

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

### Q3. "Services not starting"

**Check Docker Desktop is running:**

1. Open Docker Desktop application
2. Ensure it shows "Docker Desktop is running"

**Clean restart:**

```bash
docker-compose down -v
docker system prune -a
docker-compose up --build
```

### Q4. "Frontend shows blank screen"

**Clear browser cache:**

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

If the issue persists, open DevTools → Console to confirm there are no CORS or Socket.IO errors.

---

## 3. Docker vs Local Development

Use Docker for parity, but don’t be afraid to run services on your host when iterating quickly.

### When to prefer Docker

- One command (`docker-compose up --build`) brings up the full stack.
- Matches Fly.io/Base deployment networking (service names instead of `localhost`).
- Lowest friction for new contributors—no global Node/Foundry setup required.

### When to prefer local dev

- Hot reload is noticeably faster for the React frontend + Node backend.
- Easier to attach debuggers or run unit tests in watch mode.
- Works well when you only need a subset of services (e.g., backend + blockchain).

> 📎 Keep Docker running for the dependencies you are not touching (e.g., run backend locally but keep player service in Docker).

### Running services individually

**Backend** (see `backend/README.md` for scripts):

```bash
cd backend
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/README.md` has lint/test commands):

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

**Player Service** (lives under `backend/src/models` but shares the same pnpm workspace):

```bash
cd backend
pnpm install
pnpm player-service
```

### Local-only environment tweaks

- Update `.env` files to use `localhost` instead of service names (see the matrix above).
- Backend: `PLAYER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:5001`
- Frontend: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080`
- Player service: no change needed unless you expose a custom port.

## Stopping the Application

### Stop Services
```bash
Ctrl + C  (in terminal running docker-compose)
```

### Stop and Remove Containers
```bash
docker-compose down
```

- [`blockchain/README.md`](blockchain/README.md): Foundry toolchain, deployment scripts, and `.env` guidance.

## Contribution Workflow

- Review `CONTRIBUTING.md` for branching, commit, and PR expectations before making changes.
- Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` or `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` to describe any new work so reviewers have context.
- When opening a PR, follow `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` to summarize implementation, list tests, and confirm documentation updates.

### Stop and Remove Everything (including volumes)
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

---

## Monitoring

### View Service Logs

**All services:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f
```

**Specific service:**
```bash
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
docker-compose logs -f player-service
```

### Check Service Health

**Visit health endpoints:**
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080/health`
- Player Service: `http://localhost:5001/health`

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "service": "backend-service",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T..."
}
```

---

## Performance Tips

### Reduce Memory Usage

**Limit Docker resources:**
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Settings → Resources
3. Set Memory to 4GB (minimum)
4. Set CPUs to 2 (minimum)

### Speed Up Builds

**Use cached layers:**
```bash
docker-compose build --parallel
```

---

---

## Advanced Features

### ELO Rating System

**How it works:**
- All players start at 1000 rating
- Win against higher-rated player: gain more points
- Win against lower-rated player: gain fewer points
- Minimum gain: 5 points per win
- Rating determines leaderboard position

**Formula:**
```
New Rating = Old Rating + K * (Actual - Expected)
K = 32 (standard chess ELO)
Expected = 1 / (1 + 10^((Opponent - Player)/400))
```

### Multiple Simultaneous Games

**Architecture:**
- Each game runs independently
- Separate 60 FPS loop per game
- Isolated game state
- No cross-game interference
- Unlimited concurrent games (limited by server resources)

### Real-Time Synchronization

**How players stay in sync:**
1. Server calculates all game physics
2. Broadcasts game state 60 times/second
3. Clients render received state
4. Player inputs sent to server immediately
5. Server validates and applies inputs

**Benefits:**
- No cheating possible
- Perfect synchronization
- Fair gameplay for all players

---

## Data Persistence

### Current Setup (Development)

**Player Data:**
- Stored in memory (Map data structure)
- Lost when services restart
- Fast access, no database overhead

**Game Data:**
- Temporary per-game session
- Deleted when game ends
- Results saved to Player Service

### Production Considerations

**To add database:**
1. Add MongoDB/PostgreSQL to `docker-compose.yml`
2. Update Player Service to connect to DB
3. Replace `Map` with database queries
4. No changes needed to Backend or Frontend

## Keyboard Shortcuts

**In Game:**
- `↑` / `W` - Move paddle up
- `↓` / `S` - Move paddle down

**Browser:**
- `F12` - Open DevTools (see console logs)
- `Ctrl + Shift + R` - Hard refresh (clear cache)

---

## Support

**Issues:**
- GitHub: https://github.com/escapeSeq/k-pong/issues

**Logs Location:**
- Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Browser console: F12 → Console tab

**Common Log Patterns:**

Good:
```
✓ Server running on port 8080
✓ Socket connected with ID: abc123
✓ Game started for room: XY4K2N
```

Bad:
```
✗ Connection error: ECONNREFUSED
✗ Socket error: timeout
✗ Failed to fetch player rating
```
